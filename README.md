- To shoot arrows at balloons:
  - Reload the arrow *(Character position 1)* by right-clicking the mouse, to shoot the arrow *(Character position 2)* by left-clicking the mouse.
  - Repeat these steps for each arrow.

## Gameplay

### Level 1

- Game starts with Options (you choose the difficulty of the level you want: easy, medium, or hard by left-clicking the mouse), then level 1 starts.
- **Balloons:** Red balloons move regularly and at the same speed.
- You have 20 arrows and 15 red balloons. Whenever you shoot an arrow or an arrow collides with a balloon, the score is calculated by:
  ```Score = (Remaining Arrows + 1) * Number of Shot Balloons```
- If you use all the arrows and the arrows do not collide with all the balloons, then you have lost and get **"Sorry, you failed"** along with your score. You can retry the level by left-clicking the mouse on the **"Retry"** button, then you can choose the difficulty you want.
- If all the balloons collide with the arrows, then you have succeeded and get **"Congrats, you win!"** along with your score. You can move to level 2 by left-clicking the mouse on the **"Next level"** button, then you can choose the difficulty for the new level.

</div>

### Level 2

- In level 2, you can move the character, load arrows, and fire them in the same ways as in level 1.
- **Balloons:** There are two types of balloons, red and yellow **(3 yellow balloons + 12 red balloons)**, and they all move randomly. The yellow balloons move with acceleration, while the red ones move at a constant speed.
- When an arrow collides with a yellow balloon, the score is increased by 10 points.
  ```Score = (Remaining Arrows + 1) * Number of Shot Red Balloons + Number of Shot Yellow Balloons * 10```
- If you use all the arrows and the arrows do not collide with all the balloons, then you have lost and get **"Sorry, you failed"** along with your score. You can retry the level by left-clicking on the mouse on the **"Retry"** button, then you can choose the difficulty you want as level 1.
- If all the balloons (Red and Yellow) collide with the arrows, then you have succeeded, get **"Congrats, you win!"** along with your score.
